Application and Placement Tracker

Workflow 1
Application Logging and Updating

This would include basic CRUD operations. Enable users to organize all applications in one place with status columns, role categories, and deadline awareness.

1.  Application Dashboard: The user logs in and is directed to the main tracker dashboard.
2.  Adding a New Entry: The user clicks the '+ Add Application' button.
3.  Data Input: A form appears requiring key details:
Company Name
Role (Links to Workflow 2 for the type of resume to be uploaded)
Status
Salary
Job Type 
Location
URL
Deadline
Application Date
The user clicks 'Save'. The form closes and the new entry card is immediately added to the dashboard view in the appropriate status column.
4.  Updating or deleting an Entry: The user would click on the card in order to update the status or any other details. They can also delete the entry.
